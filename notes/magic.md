## Mage Guilds
- All the cities on the continent should be limited to Mage Guild level 2.
- The first 2 levels of mage guild provide heroes with the most useful spells in the game - therefore this is not too big of a constraint. 
- The exception to this rule are the magical schools of `Ban Ard` and `Arethusa`. Both of these cities have opened all 5 levels of mage guild.
- This creates nice advantage for heroes who visited the magical school, while not being overpowered, as expert Magic with level 1 spell is usually more efficient.

## Banned spells:
- The following spells are banned on the map and therefore cannot be used by any means: `Town portal`, `Fly`, `Dimension door`.
- The reason for this ban is that these spells are considered overpowered. They push players towards having one overpowered super hero over building multiple balanced characters.
- Furthermore, the spells do not match the Witcher lore - while transporting a character through portal is common, doing so with an entire army is far-fetched.
